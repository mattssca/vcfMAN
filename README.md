# vcfMAN
Pipeline consists of scripts (R and bash) for processing Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The purpose of this pipeline is to standardize output and perform downstream plotting for overview of relevant variant metrics and variant distribution. Pipeline takes VCF files related to both Structural Variants (SV) and small variants (variants â‰¤ 50 bp). The main outputs are tables, BED formatted variant annotations and figures.
